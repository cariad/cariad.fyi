## The job hunt

My fourth-round interview is still scheduled for Thursday this week. So still, please wish me luck!

## Travels

I haven't been anywhere. I haven't done anything. I've been in a funk. I feel much heavier than I was a month ago, but I don't dare check.

## Heydays

Well, I did go out _once_ this week. I went out to Heyday's opening day for 50% off breakfast! But it wasn't open. I found out a few days later that the opening times on the website were wrong, so I wasted a trip out. Hah!

And _double-hah_, because I didn't get a ticket to the launch party either. 1,000 people applied, but they've only got room for 100, so they sent out a second email with a link to give tickets to the first 50 folks who click, and I missed it.

Honestly, I'm more sad about all that than I think I have any reasonable right to be.

## Making things

I mentioned last week that I'd started a reindeer cross stitch. I don't know if it's my bad mood, or if I just don't like the pattern, but I've been avoiding it. It's just not fun, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to abandon it.

…but I did get to go make cat biscuits with my almost-niece! I made a cosy cat and Alex made Cursed Cat Alastor.

## Preparing for 2025

I got my 2025 planner! My first choice is always Rhodia, but I couldn't spot any nice ones this year so I went for LEUCHTTURM1917. My first choice is always A6, but their A6 2025 planners aren't out until the end of January so I went for B6+.

How big is B6+, you ask?

| B6+  | 125 × 190 |
| A6   | 90 × 150  |
| A7   | 70 × 110  |

## Perturbations

- I've lost my mojo. I don't want to go anywhere or do anything, and I'm tired all the time. I'm worried a lot about the future.

## The week ahead

- Fourth-round interview on Thursday!
